## Pre-Version 4.0 - Digshake

First, I'd like to thank Fred Coughlin for creating the Zelda Randomizer. His work is what inspired me to start this project, and he has been a great source of advice throughout this entire process.

There were a lot of people who helped with beta testing - putting up with game breaking bugs and seeds that weren't even beatable. Thank you so much JamEvil, Eunos, Breastickle, Jaylow7, Sheepno1, GTM604, xJohnWaynex, Cantoutfapme, Skavenger216, kingdahl, ShinerCCC, imchrisluke, zoeni, mrgiggums, mpaintrain, LoudGoat and others who I surely have forgotten (I'm sorry!). Without you, this randomizer would not be what it is today.

## Version 4.0 - Digshake

Special thanks go out to the participants in the first ever Zelda 2 Roomjam:

Thanks also go out to the beta testers, of which there are unfortunately too many to name here. I could not have done this without the help of the Zelda 2 community, for which I am very grateful.

Finally, thank YOU for your interest. I made this out of love for Zelda II, and the Zelda II community has been awesome to be a part of.

## Version 5.0 - Ellendar

Thanks to everyone who submitted new rooms and provided feedback to improve them as much as we can. Especially aaron2u2 for making just way too many rooms.
Thanks to everyone in #z2-sprite-workshop for submitting new sprites (yet again).
Thanks to TheAlanHeffley for coordinating the community and putting up with me constantly shipping a new beta right after he posts the SOTW
Thanks to cfrantz for creating and bentglasstube and initsu for modifications to z2edit, which has been an invaluable development / debugging tool.

Special thanks to initsu and jroweboy, without whose programming contrubutions this release would not be nearly as great.
