# Z2Randomizer
Fork of the main Zelda 2 Randomizer by Digshake

Original source is at https://bitbucket.org/digshake/z2randomizer/src/master/

Goals for this fork are in roughly decreasing order of likelyhood.
-Reduce the amount of code thrown into giant files like Hyrule.cs
-Refactor to remove as many magic numbers and undocumented ROM addresses as possible.
-Fix known issues (TODO: Get a list of known issues from Mirai/Discord and add them as issues.
-Add support for alternate configuration methods. (YAML?)
-Look into multiworld support
