		Microsoft ResX Schema

		Version 1.3

		The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
		that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
		various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
		associated with the data types.

		Example:

		... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
		<resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
		<resheader name="version">1.3</resheader>
		<resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
		<resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
		<data name="Name1">this is my long string</data>
		<data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
		<data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
			[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]
		</data>
		<data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing"
	mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
			[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]
		</data>

		There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
		name/value pairs.

		Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
		type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
		text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
		Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
		mimetype set.

		The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
		ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
		extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:

		Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
		that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
		read any of the formats listed below.

		mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
		value   : The object must be serialized with 
			: System.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
			: and then encoded with base64 encoding.

		mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
		value   : The object must be serialized with 
			: System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
			: and then encoded with base64 encoding.

		mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
		value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
			: using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
			: and then encoded with base64 encoding.

actual terrain, instead of the original vanilla terrain.</value>
	</data>
	<data name="NormalPalaceStyleToolTip" xml:space="preserve">
<value>Sets the palace generator for palaces 1 through 6. See the Wiki for more details.</value>
	</data>
	<data name="ShortenToolTip" xml:space="preserve">
<value>If selected, palaces will be fewer rooms. The exact way this is handled varies by palace
style, but on average the palace is 25% to 50% fewer rooms than otherwise.</value>
	</data>
	<data name="MinimumPathToDarkLinkToolTip" xml:space="preserve">
<value>If you think a short Great Palace at the end of the game is anticlimactic, this is the
flag for you! The shortest path to Dark Link (and to finish the game) will be at least
this many rooms from the entrance. (Doesn&apos;t affect Thunderbird.)

The Max option depends on the palace style and whether it&apos;s shortened. For example,
Reconstructed palaces have connectors that lead anywhere in the palace. This often makes
the shortest path shorter, so the max has to be lower.

This increases seed generation time if it&apos;s set high, as the palace will have to be
regenerated a lot. Setting it very high also makes it likely the Great Palace is more
linear.</value>
	</data>
	<data name="ItemRoomsPerPalaceToolTip" xml:space="preserve">
<value>Lets you select the number of item rooms per palace: 0-2 or Random.

  • Extra palace items (beyond the first) default to 200 P-Bags, but can be replaced or
    shuffled depending on other settings.

  • 0 Item Rooms:
    ◦ Palace items move to minor item locations.
      • If there aren&apos;t enough minor items to replace (based on the number of starting
        items and heart containers), you will get a popup saying the flags are
        incompatible.
      • If the item count depends on indeterminate flags, those flags will be re-rolled
        until valid.
      • If needed, the &quot;Include P-Bag Caves in Item Shuffle&quot; setting will be overriden to
        make room.

  • Vanilla palaces: Extra item rooms replace random dead ends.

  • Random Item Rooms: Each palace gets 0–4 item rooms (varies by palace length/style).
    ◦ Clouds in the entrance screen and Ironknuckle statues by the entrance elevator
      indicate how many items there are in the palace.</value>

	<data name="IncludeVanillaRoomsToolTip" xml:space="preserve">
<value>If selected, the normal zelda 2 rooms will be available for palace generation. Note that
rooms from palaces 1-6 may be found in any of those palaces. Has no effect on vanilla or
vanilla shuffle styles.</value>
	</data>
	<data name="Include40RoomsToolTip" xml:space="preserve">
<value>If selected, the first batch of community-designed custom rooms from version 4.0 will be
available. Has no effect on vanilla or vanilla shuffle styles.</value>
	</data>
	<data name="ThunderbirdRequiredToolTip" xml:space="preserve">
<value>If selected, the path to Dark Link in GP _must_ go through Thunderbird&apos;s room. The thunder
spell will be required to beat the game. When unselected, Thunderbird still appears in GP,
and may be required anyway if the palace style or randomized layout requires it.</value>
	</data>
	<data name="RemoveThunderbirdToolTip" xml:space="preserve">
<value>If selected, Thunderbird will not appear in GP. For vanilla styles, his room will be
removed and bypassed. For generated styles, one additional normal room will appear
instead.</value>
	</data>
	<data name="UseCustomRoomsFileToolTip" xml:space="preserve">
<value>If selected, rooms will be based on the file CustomRooms.json instead of PalaceRooms.json
. You may edit this file to control which rooms you want to use, or create your own rooms
that can appear. For more details, contact Ellendar or ask on the Discord.</value>
	</data>
	<data name="NumberofPalacestoCompleteToolTip" xml:space="preserve">
<value>The number of palaces that must be completed to drop the barrier and enter Gannon&apos;s
Palace. The number of required palaces is a random value between Min and Max (inclusive of
both endpoints).</value>
	</data>
	<data name="RestartatPalacesonGameOverToolTip" xml:space="preserve">
<value>If selected, on Game Over (or Up+A) you will restart at the beginning of the palace. If

	<data name="ReduceDripperVarianceToolTip" xml:space="preserve">
<value>Tired of waiting for drippers to drop an enemy? After 7 red drips, this forces the 8th

	<data name="RandomizeBossItemDropToolTip" xml:space="preserve">

	</data>
	<data name="NoDuplicateRoomsByLayoutToolTip" xml:space="preserve">
<value>Prevents palace generation from creating duplicate rooms. For this setting, a room is
considered a duplicate if the layout of the room is the same as another, ignoring enemy
sets. Has no effect on vanilla palaces. If the number of available palace rooms is too
small (like when using only one room group), duplicate rooms may be included anyway as it
would otherwise likely be impossible to produce a palace. Does not completely prevent
duplicates for Random Walk generated palaces.</value>
	</data>
	<data name="BlockingRoomsinAnyPalaceToolTip" xml:space="preserve">
<value>Allows rooms that require some spell or item to appear in any palace. Otherwise, palaces
can only contain blocks of types that appear in that palace in vanilla. For example a room
requiring glove could appear in P2, but not in P1.</value>
	</data>
	<data name="BossRoomsExitToToolTip" xml:space="preserve">
<value>Selects whether the boss room exits into the overworld (like in vanilla), or more palace
rooms. This can be selected for all palaces, Randomly per palace, or Random but the same
selection for all palaces. When a palace continues outside, there will always be an
Ironknuckle statue right before the exit like in vanilla. When the palace continues, that
statue will be removed.</value>

	<data name="HarderCarockToolTip" xml:space="preserve">
<value>Tired of just ducking in the corner and blocking? This option enables carock shooting

<value>Controls how the fire spell is treated.
  • Normal: No effect. Fire spell works like normal.
  • Pair with Random: Pairs the fire spell with a randomly selected non-fire spell. When
    you cast fire, the linked spell is cast, and vice versa.
  • Replace with Dash: Replaces the fire spell with the dash spell, which doubles link&apos;s
    max speed and accelleration for the current room. If selected this might be required
    to clear some rooms, or to use jump + dash to cross the Saria moat.
  • Random: One of these options at random.</value>
