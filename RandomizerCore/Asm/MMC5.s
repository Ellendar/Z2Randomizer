; Summary of the bug
; On a lag frame NMI is skipped, which means the hud scroll value of 0 isn't set
; We can work around this by never disabling NMI and using a soft disable instead
; and if the soft disable flag is set and NMI fires, then we need to just set the scroll to zero
; and then keep the "sprite zero" hud split check on.
; All of these changes are always on no matter the setting,
